- **Collaborative Sharing** - Share files with multiple users and maintain granular access control
- **Analytics & Tracking** - Monitor sharing metrics including the number of users with access to each document
- **User-Friendly Interface** - Intuitive design for efficient document management and navigation

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** (Vite) - Modern, fast development environment with component-based architecture
- **React Router** - Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling framework

### Backend
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side operations
- **Express.js** - Web application framework for RESTful API development
